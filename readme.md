## Introduction

The project is based on a tutorial video on YouTube which demonstrates how to utilize YOLO, OpenCV, and Python for sports analysis. The DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout provides a rich dataset ideal for testing and developing computer vision models for sports analytics.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect players and ball in the video.
- **Tracking**: Track the movement of detected objects across frames.
- **Analysis**: Perform analysis on the detected objects to gain insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Ultralytics
- Supervision
- YOLOv3 weights and configuration files
