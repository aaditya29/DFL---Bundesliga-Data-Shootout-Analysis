Here p1[0] and p2[0] are the x-coordinates, p1[1] and p2[1] are the y-coordinates.

The function uses the Euclidean distance formula:
distance = âˆš[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]

(p1[0]-p2[0])**2: Calculates the squared difference of x-coordinates
(p1[1]-p2[1])**2: Calculates the squared difference of y-coordinates
The results are added together AND
multiplied by 0.5 is used to calculate the square root of the sum.
